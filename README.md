# ilarisdiscordbot
A work in progress discord bot for the [ilaris](https://ilarisblog.wordpress.com/downloads/) ttrpg.

## How to use
The bot is still under development as soon it reaches a stable state we are 
happy to share the invite link. However, we experimentally use it on the 
[ilaris-online-con discord server](https://discord.gg/wNm69hrX2H) if you want 
to see it in action. You can also [host the bot yourself](#how-to-host).

### GeneralCommands

You can also type `!help <category>` for more info on a category.

## How to host

If you want to host this bot, please be aware that it is work in progress and
so is this guide. You don't need programming experience, but run a few
commands on the terminal. For linux/ubuntu you might get along with copy/paste.
Just raise an issue if you need more guidance.

### Get a bot token
First you need to acquire a bot token from discord. This token is basically the
login credential for your bot. Don't share it with anyone. If you don't know
how to get one: [Follow this guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)

### Install from Source:
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:XaverStiensmeier/ilarisdiscordbot.git
cd ilarisdiscordbot
```

Create and activate a virtual environment
(change the path if you like)
```sh
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/discordbot
source ~/.venvs/discordbot/bin/activate
```

and install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

save your token in a file (to be used by the bot)
```sh
mkdir data
echo YOUR_TOKEN >> data/token
```

#### Generate missing resources
Some additional ressources are required, that are not part of the repository
(yet). This include image collecionts of 
[Gatsu's Man√∂verkartenplugin](https://dsaforum.de/viewtopic.php?p=2002977#p2002979)
and all pages of the ilaris rule book: 

1. `resources/manoeverkarten/`
2. `resources/ilaris/` contains the core rules (`ilaris-001.png`, ..., `ilaris-219.png`)

To generate image files from downloaded pdfs you can use `poppler-utils`:
```sh
sudo apt install poppler-utils
pdftoppm -png FileIn.pdf outName
```
[Need more info on converting PDFs to images?](https://www.tecmint.com/convert-pdf-to-image-in-linux-commandline/)

### Run the bot
Make sure you are in the bots project folder and the environment is sourced 
(can be skipped if you just finished the installation)
```sh
cd ~/ilarisbot
source ~/.venvs/discordbot/
```
and start the actual bot with:
```sh
python ilaris_bot.py
```
As long as `ilaris_bot` is running, your ilarisdiscordbot instance is up. Enjoy.
Check the commandline or `data/discord.log` file if anything goes wrong.

### Keep the bot running
You might want to let the bot run forever on a server or remote machine.
Here tools like `screen` or `tmux` can be handy to create virtual terminals
that can be detached and run in the background. You can also compile a Docker
image and run it as a service (-d starts it in the background) that restarts 
automatically on crash or reboot:
```sh
docker compose build .
docker compose up -d
```
you can stop the bot with 
```sh
docker compose down
```

## How to dev
Contribute code by creating a PR to the dev branch. Reviewed code will be merged to dev.
After collecting a couple of features and some local test runs, it may be merged to main
and deployed. 

### Run locally in a dev environment
You can start the bot with extra settings and datapaths, if you not want to mess up your
actual data or settings. Using a seperate settings file and a dev subfolder in the data
folder (for seperate data and log files) run:
```sh
python ilaris_bot.py --settings config/settings_dev.yml --datapath data/dev
```
Missing folders and files are created automatically.

### Test the bot
There are a few tests in the `tests` folder that can be run with: 
```sh
pytest
```
They do not cover all commands or actions and don't interpret the message 
content yet, but its a quick way to make sure that code changes do not directly
cause errors in this commands. Just run it before committing changes.
